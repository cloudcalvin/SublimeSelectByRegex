Select By Regex 2.3.0
===

You can now to go through `Select By Regex: Next` matches when calling this command while input command is active.
It's more handy to do this via some keybinding.
For example, if you have this keybinding:

```
    {
        "keys": ["alt+/"],
        "command": "select_by_regex_next"
    }
```

See [README](https://github.com/mvoidex/SublimeSelectByRegex) for more info.
